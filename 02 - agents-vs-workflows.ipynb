Developed from MiniMax-Text-01, this open-weight model achieves unprecedented efficiency in processing long-context tasks while maintaining high performance across diverse benchmarks. With 456 billion parameters (45.9B activated per token) and support for **1 million tokens of context length**, MiniMax-M1 outperforms competitors like DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B in software engineering, tool use, and long-context understanding.\n",

      "   - **Clips importance sampling weights** instead of token updates, stabilizing training.  \n",
      "   - Achieves **2x faster training** than DAPO (Yu et al., 2025) by preserving gradient contributions from all tokens.  \n",
      "   - Empirical validation shows superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., AIME 2024).  \n",

       "\n",
       "## Introduction  \n",
       "MiniMax-M1 represents a significant advancement in large reasoning models (LRMs), combining a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with a novel **lightning attention mechanism**. Developed from MiniMax-Text-01, this open-weight model achieves unprecedented efficiency in processing long-context tasks while maintaining high performance across diverse benchmarks. With 456 billion parameters (45.9B activated per token) and support for **1 million tokens of context length**, MiniMax-M1 outperforms competitors like DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B in software engineering, tool use, and long-context understanding.\n",

       "## Key Innovations  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Lightning Attention Mechanism**  \n",
       "   - Reduces FLOPs by **75%** for 100K-token generations compared to traditional attention.  \n",
       "   - Enables **near-linear scaling** for long sequences via a hybrid design:  \n",
       "     - Combines transformer blocks (softmax attention) with **Transnormer blocks** (linear attention).  \n",
       "   - Supports **8x longer context** than DeepSeek R1 (1M vs. 128K tokens).  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **CISPO: A Novel RL Algorithm**  \n",
       "   - **Clips importance sampling weights** instead of token updates, stabilizing training.  \n",
       "   - Achieves **2x faster training** than DAPO (Yu et al., 2025) by preserving gradient contributions from all tokens.  \n",
       "   - Empirical validation shows superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., AIME 2024).  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Training Efficiency**  \n",
       "   - Full RL training completed in **3 weeks** on 512 H800 GPUs ($534,700 cost).  \n",
       "   - Techniques like **FP32 precision for LM heads** and **early truncation heuristics** mitigate instability during scaling.  \n",
